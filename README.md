# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning Model that takes the given CSV file as a dataset and train the model on the same dataset. The model will predict the quality of the wine based on various factors and give the data visualization. We have used a scatter plot for the same purpose. The problem is of regression type so we have used the Mean Absolute Error and R-Squared Error to calculate the accuracy of model. For the regressor type we have used XGBRegressor.
